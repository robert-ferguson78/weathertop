                Many people have a great interest in weather and have their own automatic weather stations to see what
                the temperature is or how much rain falls in their garden. In the past 20 years, automatic weather
                stations have become more affordable and user friendly. Basic automatic weather stations can be bought
                which measure outside air temperature, humidity and barometric pressure and display it on an electronic
                device indoors. Many amateur weather observers have sophisticated automatic weather stations by
                companies like Davis, Oregon Scientific, La Crosse and others.

                These AWSs measure air temperature, humidity and barometric pressure like the basic models, but often
                have rain-gauges to measure rainfall,
                anemometers for measuring wind speed and direction, ground temperature and solar radiation sensors and
                more. Some companies, such as Netatmo, have their own website where the data from their weather stations
                can be automatically uploaded. Since most people live in towns and cities, the amateur weather
                observersâ€™ stations are, unsurprisingly, clustered in urban areas.

                WeatherTop would love amateur weather observers to upload data from their AWSs to http://localhost:9000/
                By sharing your data you are helping to improve the Irish weather observing network and helping
                WeatherTop forecasters to get a better picture of weather around Ireland. Your data will also be shared
                with anybody who looks at the WeatherTop website!

                Amateur weather observers in Ireland contribute to the field of citizen science through their monitoring
                of Irish weather and building up our store of weather data. WeatherTop and other weather
                services use crowdsource weather data to improve meteorological knowledge of the
                weather. The science of meteorology has a strong background in citizen science. The earliest weather
                observations were often taken by amateur and voluntary observers. There are many voluntary observers
                around Ireland who have been taking rainfall measurements every morning for many decades.
